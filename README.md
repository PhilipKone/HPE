# Human Pose Estimation Workflow

This document provides an overview of the human pose estimation workflow, breaking down each major step into detailed subsections.

## 1. Input Image/Video
The process begins with an input image or video containing one or more humans. This input serves as the raw data for the pose estimation pipeline.

---

## 2. Preprocessing
Preprocessing prepares the input data for further analysis by the model. It includes the following steps:
- **Resize Image**: Adjust the image dimensions to match the input size required by the model.
- **Normalize Pixel Values**: Scale pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, or cropping to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model robustness.

---

## 3. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction involves identifying important patterns or features in the input data using a deep learning model:
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN is used to process the image and extract hierarchical features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Extract Key Features**: The CNN outputs a set of feature maps that represent the most relevant information for pose estimation.

## 4. Pose Estimation Model
The pose estimation model predicts the positions of keypoints (joints) in the human body:
- **Predict Keypoints (Joints)**: The model identifies the coordinates of keypoints such as shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.
- **Heatmap Generation**: A heatmap is generated for each keypoint, indicating the probability of its location in the image.

---

## 5. Postprocessing
Postprocessing refines the model's predictions and constructs the final human pose:
- **Refine Keypoints**: Adjust the predicted keypoints to improve accuracy and remove noise.
- **Connect Keypoints to Form Skeleton**: Link the keypoints to form a skeleton structure representing the human pose.

## 6. Output Pose (Skeleton)
The final output is a skeleton overlayed on the input image or video, showing the estimated human pose. This output can be used for various applications such as activity recognition, animation, or sports analysis.

## Exporting the Diagram
To visualize the workflow, you can export the PlantUML diagram as a PNG or SVG:
1. Use a PlantUML editor (e.g., VS Code plugin, IntelliJ plugin, or PlantText online editor).
2. Run the rendering command to generate the diagram.
3. Save the output as PNG or SVG.

Alternatively, use the PlantUML command-line tool:
```bash
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng human_pose_estimation.puml  # For PNG
java -jar plantuml.jar -tsvg human_pose_estimation.puml  # For SVG
```

This workflow provides a structured approach to human pose estimation, breaking down the process into manageable steps for better understanding and implementation.
