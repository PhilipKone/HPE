# Human Pose Estimation Project

## Overview
This project explores and enhances bottom-up human pose estimation methods. It combines literature review, research articles, code implementations, and workflow diagrams to support research and experimentation in this field.

## Project Structure
- **Human Pose Estimation Workflow.md**: Step-by-step workflow for pose estimation.
- **Enhancing_Bottom_Up_Human_Pose_Estimation.md**: Details on improving bottom-up pipelines.
- **Literature_Review.md**: Summarizes key research and findings.
- **relevant_articles_comprehensive.md**: Comprehensive list of relevant articles.
- **articles/**: Contains grouped research articles, tables, and supporting materials organized by research objectives.
- **simple_bottom_up_pose.py**: Python implementation for pose estimation.
- **hello.m**: MATLAB script for prototyping or demonstration.
- **hello.R**: R script for data analysis and visualization.
- **.puml files**: PlantUML diagrams for visualizing frameworks and pipelines.

## Getting Started
1. **Review Documentation**: Start with the markdown files for workflow, literature review, and research objectives.
2. **Explore Code**:
   - Run Python scripts with: `python simple_bottom_up_pose.py`
   - Run MATLAB scripts with: Open `hello.m` in MATLAB and execute.
   - Run R scripts with: Open `hello.R` in R or VS Code and run.
3. **Visualize Diagrams**: Use a PlantUML editor or the command line to render `.puml` files:
   ```bash
   java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng <diagram>.puml
   ```
4. **Research Articles**: Browse the `articles/` directory for grouped research, tables, and supporting documents by objective.

## Requirements
- Python (for .py scripts)
- MATLAB (for .m scripts)
- R and R Extension for VS Code (for .R scripts)
- PlantUML (for diagram rendering)

## Contribution
Feel free to add new research articles, code experiments, or update documentation to support ongoing research in human pose estimation.
