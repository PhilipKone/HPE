## 1.1 Background of Study

Human pose estimation (HPE) has emerged as a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with far-reaching implications across domains such as healthcare, sports analytics, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems (Cao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2019). At its core, HPE involves detecting and localizing human body joints (keypoints) in images or videos, enabling machines to interpret and analyze human movement and posture. As we move toward more sophisticated human-machine interaction systems and automated analysis of human activities, the importance of robust and accurate HPE continues to grow.

The evolution of HPE has been marked by significant paradigm shifts, from early rule-based approaches to modern deep learning-based methods. Traditional approaches, such as pictorial structures and deformable part models, relied on handcrafted features and probabilistic models (Wei et al., 2024). While pioneering, these methods faced limitations in handling the complexity of real-world scenarios—especially in cases of occlusion, scale variation, and complex poses—often resulting in poor generalization across diverse environments and human appearances.

With the advent of deep learning, HPE experienced a revolution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enabled the learning of hierarchical feature representations directly from data, greatly improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation (Sun et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). This progress led to two primary methodological paradigms: top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down methods, such as Mask R-CNN and HRNet, first detect human bounding boxes and then estimate keypoints within each box (Cheng et al., 2020). While highly accurate, these approaches can struggle in crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and increased computational cost.

Bottom-up approaches, including OpenPose (Cao et al., 2021), HigherHRNet (Cheng et al., 2020), and more recently DEKR, detect all keypoints in an image first and then group them into individual poses. These methods offer superior scalability and efficiency, making them well-suited for real-time applications and crowded environments. However, they also face challenges, particularly in the accurate association of keypoints and in handling significant scale variation among individuals in the same scene (Du & Yu, 2022; Yu et al., 2022).

A central technical component of HPE systems is heatmap generation, which represents the likelihood of keypoint locations in an image. Traditional heatmap generation relies on fixed Gaussian kernels, assuming constant scale and orientation for all keypoints (Luo et al., 2021). This assumption is problematic in real-world scenarios, where people appear at different scales and orientations due to perspective and camera angle. As a result, fixed kernels can miss fine-grained spatial details, leading to inaccurate localization—especially for small or occluded body parts (Gu et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2024).

Recent research has emphasized the need for scale-aware and adaptive approaches. Notably, Han Yu et al. (2022) introduced the Scale-Aware Heatmap Generator (SAHG), which customizes the Gaussian kernel variance based on the relative scale of each keypoint. This adaptive approach allows heatmaps to more accurately represent keypoints of varying sizes and has demonstrated improved localization accuracy, particularly in complex, multi-scale, and crowded environments. However, integrating such adaptive Gaussian kernels into high-performance bottom-up frameworks—such as DEKR, which is known for its state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency—remains an open research challenge, especially when balancing real-time performance and accuracy (Li & Wang, 2022; Kamel et al., 2021).

This thesis is among the first to address this gap by designing and implementing adaptive Gaussian kernels inspired by SAHG and integrating them directly into the DEKR framework. By doing so, it aims to advance the state of the art in bottom-up pose estimation, achieving scale-invariant, robust, and efficient keypoint localization. This integration not only addresses a critical challenge in the literature but also paves the way for more accurate and practical applications of HPE in real-world scenarios.

The following section details the specific problem statement motivating this research.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite significant advances in human pose estimation (HPE), current bottom-up frameworks continue to face major challenges in accurately localizing keypoints under conditions of scale variation, occlusion, and orientation ambiguity. Traditional heatmap generation methods, which rely on fixed Gaussian kernels, are fundamentally limited in their ability to adapt to the diverse scales and shapes of human figures encountered in real-world images (Luo et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024). This limitation is particularly pronounced in crowded scenes, where individuals may appear at vastly different sizes and orientations due to perspective effects and camera angles.

The inability of fixed Gaussian kernels to dynamically adjust to varying person sizes and keypoint scales results in suboptimal localization, especially for small, distant, or partially occluded body parts (Du & Yu, 2022; Li & Wang, 2022). As a consequence, bottom-up approaches—despite their computational efficiency and scalability—often struggle to deliver robust performance in complex, real-world environments where scale and orientation vary widely (Gu et al., 2020; Park & Park, 2021).

Recent research has proposed adaptive, scale-aware Gaussian kernels as a promising solution to these challenges (Yu et al., 2022; Han Yu et al., 2022). However, the integration of such adaptive kernels into state-of-the-art bottom-up frameworks, such as DEKR, remains underexplored. Key technical challenges persist, including the need for efficient parameter learning strategies, the design of effective loss functions for adaptive kernel training, and the maintenance of real-time inference speed without sacrificing localization accuracy.

Therefore, the core problem addressed in this research is:  
**How can adaptive, scale-aware Gaussian kernels be effectively integrated into a high-performance bottom-up pose estimation framework (DEKR) to achieve robust, scale-invariant, and efficient keypoint localization in complex, real-world scenarios?**  
This research aims to fill this gap by developing and evaluating a novel adaptive kernel design and integration strategy, with the goal of advancing the accuracy and practical applicability of bottom-up HPE systems.

## 1.3 Objectives

The main objectives of this research are:

1. **To design and implement scale-aware adaptive Gaussian kernels** for heatmap generation in human pose estimation, enabling robust localization of keypoints across varying person sizes, scales, and orientations.
2. **To integrate these adaptive Gaussian kernels into the DEKR bottom-up pose estimation framework**, ensuring compatibility with high-resolution feature extraction and maintaining real-time inference performance.
3. **To develop efficient learning strategies and optimization techniques**—including novel loss functions and parameterization methods—for training adaptive kernels, with the goal of improving both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the overall pose estimation system.

## 1.4 Outline of Methodology

The methodology of this research is structured to address the three primary objectives, with each phase building upon the previous to ensure a systematic and rigorous approach to integrating adaptive Gaussian kernels into the DEKR framework for human pose estimation. The main steps are as follows:

1. **Designing Scale-Aware Adaptive Gaussian Kernels**  
   - Develop a parametric Gaussian kernel function that dynamically adjusts its size and shape based on person instance scale and keypoint characteristics.
   - Implement scale-aware and orientation-aware components to enhance robustness across diverse poses, scales, and camera angles.
   - Validate the adaptability and effectiveness of the kernel design through both synthetic data and real-world test scenarios.

2. **Developing Efficient Learning Strategies and Optimization Techniques**  
   - Design novel loss functions and parameterization schemes specifically tailored for adaptive heatmap generation.
   - Implement optimization methods that balance accuracy and computational efficiency, including multi-stage training pipelines for progressive refinement of kernel parameters.
   - Evaluate learning efficiency and model convergence using established performance metrics.

3. **Integration and Evaluation within the DEKR Bottom-Up Framework**  
   - Select and adapt the DEKR framework as the baseline for bottom-up pose estimation.
   - Integrate the adaptive Gaussian kernel module while preserving high-resolution feature extraction and maintaining real-time inference capabilities.
   - Conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, MPII), focusing on:
     - Scale adaptability and robustness
     - Pose estimation accuracy
     - Computational efficiency and real-time performance
     - Comparative analysis with fixed-kernel baselines and state-of-the-art methods

The methodology follows an iterative approach, with each phase building upon the results of the previous one. This ensures continuous refinement and validation of the proposed methods while maintaining focus on practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

## 1.5 Justification

The justification for this research lies in both the theoretical advancement of human pose estimation (HPE) methodologies and the practical need for robust, real-time systems in complex, real-world environments.

From a theoretical perspective, this research addresses a critical gap in the literature by developing and integrating scale-aware adaptive Gaussian kernels into a state-of-the-art bottom-up framework (DEKR). Traditional fixed Gaussian kernels are fundamentally limited in their ability to adapt to varying person sizes, orientations, and occlusion scenarios, leading to suboptimal keypoint localization—especially in crowded or multi-scale settings (Luo et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024). By building on recent advances such as the Scale-Aware Heatmap Generator (SAHG) (Han Yu et al., 2022), this work proposes a novel kernel design that dynamically adjusts its parameters based on local context, thus enhancing the accuracy and robustness of heatmap-based pose estimation (Du & Yu, 2022; Li & Wang, 2022).

Practically, the integration of adaptive Gaussian kernels into the DEKR framework directly addresses the need for efficient, scalable, and accurate pose estimation in applications such as healthcare (for patient monitoring and rehabilitation), sports analytics (for movement analysis and performance evaluation), human-computer interaction, and surveillance (Lee et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2020; Park & Park, 2021; Kamel et al., 2021). Bottom-up approaches like DEKR are favored for their computational efficiency and real-time performance, but their effectiveness is currently constrained by limitations in handling scale variation and occlusion. This research bridges that gap by enabling adaptive, context-aware heatmap generation without sacrificing speed or scalability.

Moreover, the methodological innovations proposed in this work—such as new loss functions, optimization strategies, and kernel parameterization—have broader implications for other computer vision tasks that require precise spatial localization, including object detection and image segmentation (Gu et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021).

In summary, this research is justified by its potential to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical deployment of robust, scale-invariant pose estimation systems. By addressing the intertwined challenges of scale variation, orientation ambiguity, and computational efficiency, this work contributes to the development of next-generation HPE systems capable of reliable operation in real-world scenarios.

# Chapter 2 - Literature Review

## 2.1 Introduction

This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature on human pose estimation, with particular focus on heatmap generation, adaptive Gaussian kernels, and bottom-up approaches. The review is structured around the three main objectives of this research, providing a detailed analysis of current methodologies, their limitations, and opportunities for improvement. By examining both traditional and modern approaches, this chapter establishes the theoretical foundation for the proposed adaptive Gaussian kernel methodology.

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of human pose estimation systems (Sun et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). However, challenges persist in handling scale variations, occlusions, and orientation ambiguities, particularly in crowded scenes (Wei et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2020). This review critically analyzes these challenges and evaluates existing solutions, setting the stage for the proposed methodology.

## 2.2 Objective 1: Design Adaptive Gaussian Kernels

### 2.2.1 Traditional Methods

Traditional approaches to human pose estimation relied heavily on handcrafted features and probabilistic models. Pictorial structures and deformable part models (DPMs) were among the earliest methods, using rigid templates to represent human body parts (Wei et al., 2024). While these methods provided a foundation for pose estimation, they faced significant limitations in handling complex poses and occlusions. The rigid nature of these models often led to poor generalization across different environments and human appearances.

Random forests and regression-based methods emerged as more flexible alternatives, offering better handling of pose variations (Cao et al., 2021). However, these methods still struggled with scale variations and required extensive feature engineering. The introduction of heatmap-based approaches marked a significant advancement, but the use of fixed Gaussian kernels limited their effectiveness in real-world scenarios (Luo et al., 2021).

### 2.2.2 Deep Learning-Based Methods

The advent of deep learning revolutionized human pose estimation, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enabling the learning of hierarchical feature representations directly from data (Sun et al., 2019). This led to the development of two primary approaches: top-down and bottom-up methods.

Top-down approaches, exemplified by methods like Mask R-CNN and HRNet, first detect human bounding boxes and then estimate keypoints within each box (Cheng et al., 2020). While these methods achieve high accuracy, they face challenges in crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and high computational costs. The dependency on accurate person detection also introduces potential error propagation in the pose estimation pipeline.

In contrast, bottom-up approaches, such as OpenPose (Cao et al., 2021) and HigherHRNet (Cheng et al., 2020), detect all keypoints in an image and then group them into individual poses. These methods offer better scalability and efficiency, making them more suitable for real-time applications and crowded scenes. However, they face challenges in accurately associating keypoints and handling scale variations across different individuals in the same scene (Du & Yu, 2022; Yu et al., 2022).

### 2.2.3 Gaussian Kernels

Gaussian kernels have become the de facto standard for generating heatmaps in human pose estimation tasks. In this context, each keypoint is represented as a 2D Gaussian distribution centered at its ground-truth location, with the heatmap intensity at each pixel reflecting the likelihood of the keypoint’s presence. Mathematically, the value at pixel $(x, y)$ for keypoint $i$ is typically defined as:

$$
H_i(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

where $(x_i, y_i)$ is the ground-truth keypoint location and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation controlling the spread of the Gaussian.

#### Limitations of Fixed Gaussian Kernels

While fixed Gaussian kernels are simple and effective for representing keypoint uncertainty, they are fundamentally limited in their ability to handle the diversity of human scales and poses present in real-world images (Luo et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024). Specifically:

- **Scale Sensitivity:** A single, fixed \(\sigma\) value cannot accommodate both large and small person instances in the same image, leading to poor localization for small or distant keypoints and excessive overlap for large-scale keypoints.
- **Occlusion and Crowding:** In crowded scenes, fixed kernels often result in overlapping heatmaps, making it difficult to distinguish between closely spaced keypoints (Gu et al., 2020).
- **Orientation and Aspect Ratio:** Fixed, isotropic kernels do not account for the orientation or aspect ratio of body parts, further limiting localization accuracy in complex poses.

#### Adaptive and Scale-Aware Kernels

To address these limitations, recent research has proposed adaptive or scale-aware Gaussian kernels, where the spread ($\sigma$) and potentially the shape of the kernel are dynamically determined based on local context (Yu et al., 2022; Han Yu et al., 2022). One notable approach is the Scale-Aware Heatmap Generator (SAHG), which sets the variance of the Gaussian according to the estimated scale of the person or keypoint, allowing the heatmap to more accurately reflect spatial uncertainty across a range of scales:

$$
\sigma^2_i = \max(s_i, s_{thr}) \cdot \frac{\sigma^2}{s_{thr}}
$$

where $s_i$ is the estimated scale for keypoint $i$ and $s_{thr}$ is a threshold parameter (Han Yu et al., 2022).

Adaptive kernels have been shown to improve keypoint localization, especially in challenging scenarios involving scale variation, occlusion, and crowding. However, their integration into high-performance, real-time bottom-up frameworks remains an open research challenge (Li & Wang, 2022; Kamel et al., 2021).

**Critical Gap:**  
Despite their promise, adaptive Gaussian kernels are not yet widely adopted in state-of-the-art bottom-up systems like DEKR. Most existing frameworks still rely on fixed kernels, limiting their robustness in real-world applications. This research aims to bridge this gap by designing and integrating scale-aware adaptive Gaussian kernels into the DEKR framework, with the goal of achieving scale-invariant and robust pose estimation.

Gaussian kernels play a crucial role in heatmap generation for human pose estimation. Traditional approaches use fixed Gaussian kernels that assume a constant scale and orientation for all keypoints (Luo et al., 2021). This assumption proves problematic in real-world scenarios where humans appear at different scales and orientations due to perspective distortions and varying camera angles.

Recent research has highlighted the importance of scale-aware approaches in heatmap generation. Studies by Yu et al. (2022) and Du & Yu (2022) have demonstrated the effectiveness of adaptive Gaussian kernels that can dynamically adjust their parameters based on the local context. These approaches have shown promising results in handling scale variations and improving keypoint localization accuracy.

The design of adaptive Gaussian kernels involves several key considerations:

1. Scale awareness: The kernel should adjust its size based on the person's scale in the image
2. Orientation awareness: The kernel should adapt to the orientation of body parts
3. Computational efficiency: The adaptation process should not significantly increase computational overhead
4. Integration with deep learning frameworks: The kernel should be compatible with modern neural network architectures

Current implementations of adaptive kernels face challenges in balancing these requirements while maintaining real-time performance (Li & Wang, 2022). The proposed methodology aims to address these challenges by developing a novel approach to adaptive Gaussian kernel design that optimizes both accuracy and efficiency.

## 2.3 Objective 2: Develop an Efficient Learning and Optimization Approach

### 2.3.1 Optimization Techniques

The development of efficient learning strategies for adaptive Gaussian kernels requires careful consideration of optimization techniques. Traditional optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, have been widely used in deep learning-based pose estimation (Sun et al., 2019). However, these methods face challenges when applied to adaptive kernel parameters due to the complex relationship between kernel parameters and pose estimation accuracy (Li & Wang, 2022).

Recent advances in optimization have introduced more sophisticated approaches for parameter learning. Adaptive optimization methods, such as Adam and its variants, have shown promise in handling the non-convex optimization landscape of pose estimation tasks (Cao et al., 2021). These methods dynamically adjust learning rates based on parameter gradients, which is particularly beneficial for learning adaptive kernel parameters that may have different scales and sensitivities (Du & Yu, 2022).

Multi-stage optimization strategies have emerged as an effective approach for training complex pose estimation systems (Li et al., 2023). These strategies typically involve:

1. Initial parameter estimation using simplified models
2. Progressive refinement of parameters through iterative optimization
3. Fine-tuning of the complete system with all components integrated

### 2.3.2 Loss Functions

The design of appropriate loss functions is crucial for effective learning of adaptive Gaussian kernel parameters. Traditional mean squared error (MSE) loss functions, while simple to implement, often fail to capture the complex relationships between kernel parameters and pose estimation accuracy (Luo et al., 2021).

Recent research has proposed several specialized loss functions for heatmap-based pose estimation:

1. Scale-aware loss functions that account for varying person sizes (Yu et al., 2022)
2. Orientation-sensitive losses that consider the spatial distribution of keypoints (Gu et al., 2020)
3. Composite loss functions that combine multiple objectives (Wei et al., 2024)

These specialized loss functions have demonstrated improved performance in handling scale variations and orientation ambiguities. However, they often introduce additional computational overhead and require careful balancing of different loss components (Li & Wang, 2022).

### 2.3.3 Parameterization Strategies

Effective parameterization of adaptive Gaussian kernels is essential for both learning efficiency and model performance. Current approaches employ various parameterization strategies:

1. **Direct Parameterization**: Directly learning kernel parameters (e.g., standard deviation, orientation) through backpropagation (Du & Yu, 2022). While straightforward, this approach can lead to unstable training and poor generalization.
2. **Indirect Parameterization**: Learning intermediate representations that are then transformed into kernel parameters (Yu et al., 2022). This approach often provides better stability but may introduce additional complexity.
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining direct and indirect parameterization to balance stability and flexibility (Li & Wang, 2022).

Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and ensuring generalization. Common approaches include:

- L1/L2 regularization of kernel parameters
- Dropout in the parameter prediction network
- Early stopping based on validation performance

The choice of parameterization strategy significantly impacts both the learning efficiency and the final performance of the pose estimation system (Cao et al., 2021). Recent work has shown that carefully designed parameterization strategies can improve both accuracy and computational efficiency (Wei et al., 2024).

The integration of these optimization techniques, loss functions, and parameterization strategies forms a comprehensive learning framework for adaptive Gaussian kernels. However, challenges remain in balancing computational efficiency with model performance, particularly in real-time applications (Kamel et al., 2021). The proposed methodology aims to address these challenges by developing a novel learning approach that optimizes both aspects simultaneously.

## 2.4 Objective 3: Integrate Adaptive Kernels with Bottom-Up Pose Estimation Frameworks

### 2.4.1 Bottom-Up Frameworks

Bottom-up pose estimation frameworks have emerged as a powerful approach for handling multiple people in images, particularly in crowded scenes (Cao et al., 2021). These frameworks typically consist of two main stages: keypoint detection and grouping. The first stage detects all potential keypoints in the image, while the second stage associates these keypoints into individual poses (Cheng et al., 2020).

Modern bottom-up frameworks leverage deep learning architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance. OpenPose (Cao et al., 2021) introduced the concept of Part Affinity Fields (PAFs) for keypoint association, while HigherHRNet (Cheng et al., 2020) improved upon this by maintaining high-resolution features throughout the network. These frameworks have demonstrated impressive results in various benchmarks, but their performance is often limited by the fixed Gaussian kernels used in heatmap generation (Luo et al., 2021).

Key characteristics of successful bottom-up frameworks include:

1. High-resolution feature preservation
2. Efficient keypoint detection
3. Robust keypoint association
4. Real-time performance capabilities

### 2.4.2 Integration Challenges

The integration of adaptive Gaussian kernels with bottom-up frameworks presents several technical challenges. One of the primary challenges is maintaining computational efficiency while incorporating the additional complexity of adaptive kernels (Li & Wang, 2022). The dynamic nature of adaptive kernels requires careful consideration of memory usage and processing speed, particularly in real-time applications (Kamel et al., 2021).

Another significant challenge is ensuring compatibility between the adaptive kernel parameters and the existing framework architecture (Du & Yu, 2022). This includes:

1. Parameter synchronization across different network layers
2. Gradient flow through the adaptive components
3. Memory management for dynamic kernel parameters

The integration must also address the potential impact on the framework's ability to handle crowded scenes and occlusions (Wei et al., 2024). Adaptive kernels need to be carefully designed to avoid introducing artifacts or biases that could affect the overall pose estimation accuracy (Yu et al., 2022).

### 2.4.3 Opportunities for Improvement

Recent research has identified several opportunities for improving the integration of adaptive kernels with bottom-up frameworks. One promising direction is the development of lightweight adaptive mechanisms that minimize computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits (Li et al., 2023). This includes:

1. **Efficient Parameter Prediction**: Developing compact networks for predicting kernel parameters (Du & Yu, 2022)
2. **Selective Adaptation**: Applying adaptive kernels only where necessary based on scene complexity (Yu et al., 2022)
3. **Hardware Optimization**: Leveraging modern hardware capabilities for efficient implementation (Kamel et al., 2021)

Another opportunity lies in the development of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different methodologies (Wei et al., 2024). For example:

- Integrating attention mechanisms with adaptive kernels
- Combining top-down and bottom-up strategies
- Incorporating temporal information for video-based pose estimation

The successful integration of adaptive kernels with bottom-up frameworks could significantly improve pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios (Cao et al., 2021). This includes:

1. Better handling of scale variations in crowded scenes
2. Improved accuracy for occluded keypoints
3. More robust performance across different camera viewpoints
4. Enhanced real-time capabilities for practical applications

Recent work by Luo et al. (2021) and Li & Wang (2022) has demonstrated the potential benefits of such integration, showing improvements in both accuracy and robustness. However, further research is needed to fully realize these benefits while maintaining the computational efficiency that makes bottom-up approaches attractive for real-world applications.

## 2.5 Summary

This chapter has presented a comprehensive review of the literature on human pose estimation, with particular focus on heatmap generation, adaptive Gaussian kernels, and bottom-up approaches. The review has been structured around the three main objectives of this research, revealing both the current state of the art and the opportunities for advancement.

The review of traditional and deep learning-based methods (Section 2.2) has demonstrated the evolution of pose estimation from rigid template-based approaches to sophisticated neural network architectures (Sun et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). While deep learning has significantly improved accuracy and robustness, challenges remain in handling scale variations and occlusions, particularly in crowded scenes (Wei et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2020). The analysis of Gaussian kernels has highlighted the limitations of fixed approaches and the potential benefits of adaptive solutions (Luo et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022).

The examination of learning and optimization approaches (Section 2.3) has revealed the complexity of training adaptive systems. Traditional optimization methods face challenges when applied to adaptive kernel parameters (Li & Wang, 2022), while specialized loss functions and parameterization strategies offer promising solutions (Du & Yu, 2022). However, the trade-off between computational efficiency and model performance remains a significant challenge (Kamel et al., 2021).

The analysis of bottom-up frameworks and their integration with adaptive kernels (Section 2.4) has identified both opportunities and challenges. Modern frameworks like OpenPose (Cao et al., 2021) and HigherHRNet (Cheng et al., 2020) have demonstrated impressive results, but their performance is limited by fixed Gaussian kernels. The integration of adaptive kernels presents technical challenges in terms of computational efficiency and architectural compatibility (Li & Wang, 2022), but also offers significant opportunities for improvement in handling scale variations and occlusions (Wei et al., 2024).

Several key research gaps have been identified through this review:

1. **Scale and Orientation Handling**: Current methods struggle to effectively handle varying scales and orientations in crowded scenes (Yu et al., 2022; Du & Yu, 2022).
2. **Computational Efficiency**: The integration of adaptive components often comes at the cost of increased computational complexity (Li & Wang, 2022; Kamel et al., 2021).
3. **Framework Integration**: The seamless integration of adaptive kernels with existing bottom-up frameworks remains a challenge (Luo et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021).

These findings directly inform the proposed methodology outlined in Chapter 3. The review has established the theoretical foundation for developing adaptive Gaussian kernels that can effectively handle scale variations while maintaining computational efficiency. The identified research gaps provide clear direction for the development of novel solutions that address the limitations of current approaches.

The literature review has also highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance between accuracy and efficiency, particularly for real-world applications. This balance will be a key consideration in the design and implementation of the proposed methodology, ensuring that the developed solutions are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

# Chapter 3 – Proposed Methodology

## 3.1 Overview of the Proposed Pipeline

The proposed pipeline for integrating adaptive Gaussian kernels into bottom-up full-body pose estimation is designed to address the research objectives through the following stages:

1. **Input Preprocessing:**  
   Raw images from benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, MPII) are normalized and augmented (scaling, rotation, flipping).
2. **Scale and Orientation Estimation:**  
   For each person instance or keypoint, estimate the scale (e.g., bounding box size or keypoint spread) and, if applicable, orientation.  
   - Let $s_i$ denote the estimated scale for keypoint $i$.
   - Let $\theta_i$ denote the estimated orientation (if used).
3. **Adaptive Heatmap Generation:**  
   Ground-truth heatmaps are generated using adaptive Gaussian kernels, where kernel parameters are set per keypoint:
   $$
   H_i(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x - x_i \\
   y - y_i
   \end{bmatrix}^T
   \Sigma_i^{-1}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x - x_i \\
   y - y_i
   \end{bmatrix}
   \right)
   $$
   - For isotropic (scale-aware) kernels:
     $$
     \Sigma_i = \sigma_i^2 I
     $$
     $$
     \sigma_i^2 = \max(s_i, s_{thr}) \cdot \frac{\sigma^2}{s_{thr}}
     $$
   - For anisotropic (orientation-aware) kernels (optional):
     $$
     \Sigma_i = R(\theta_i)
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \sigma_{i,x}^2 & 0 \\
     0 & \sigma_{i,y}^2
     \end{bmatrix}
     R(\theta_i)^T
     $$
     where $R(\theta_i)$ is the 2D rotation matrix for angle $\theta_i$.
4. **Network Architecture (Modified DEKR):**  
   - Input preprocessed images into the DEKR backbone.
   - The network is trained to regress adaptive heatmaps as defined above.
5. **Loss Function and Optimization:**  
   - Use a loss function comparing predicted heatmaps $\hat{H}_i(x, y)$ to ground-truth adaptive heatmaps $H_i(x, y)$:
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{heatmap} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{x,y} w_i(x, y) \left( \hat{H}_i(x, y) - H_i(x, y) \right)^2
     $$
     where $w_i(x, y)$ is a weighting term (e.g., to emphasize small keypoints or handle class imbalance).
6. **Keypoint Grouping and Post-processing:**  
   - Extract keypoint locations from predicted heatmaps.
   - Group keypoints into person instances using DEKR’s associative embedding, accounting for variable kernel sizes.
7. **Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate the pipeline using standard metrics (AP, AR, computational efficiency) on benchmark datasets.
   - Compare results with fixed-kernel and state-of-the-art baselines.

*Figure 3.1: Overview of the proposed adaptive Gaussian kernel pipeline for bottom-up pose estimation*

</center>

The flowchart above illustrates the complete pipeline of the proposed methodology. The process begins with an input image that undergoes feature extraction. The extracted features are then used for both person scale estimation and keypoint detection. These components feed into the adaptive Gaussian kernel generation module, which produces scale-aware and orientation-aware heatmaps. The heatmaps are then processed through keypoint grouping to generate the final pose estimation output.

The adaptive kernel generation components section details the core parameters of the kernel generation process, including scale parameters, orientation parameters, and center coordinates. The training pipeline illustrates the multi-stage training process and the various loss functions used to optimize the system.

## 3.2 Methodology Based on Objectives

### 3.2.1 Objective 1: Design and Develop Adaptive Gaussian Kernels

The design of adaptive Gaussian kernels in this dissertation is directly informed by the Scale-Aware Heatmap Generator (SAHG) proposed by Han Yu, Congju Du, and Li Yu (2022). Their method customizes the variance of the Gaussian kernel for each keypoint type according to its relative scale, rather than using a fixed variance for all keypoints. Specifically, the variance for each keypoint is determined as:

$$
\sigma^2_i = \max(s_i, s_{thr}) \cdot \frac{\sigma^2}{s_{thr}}
$$

where $s_i$ is the relative scale for keypoint type $i$ and $s_{thr}$ is a minimum threshold. This adaptive approach ensures the generated heatmaps more accurately reflect the spatial uncertainty and size of each keypoint, improving localization accuracy, particularly for small or large keypoints. In this work, only the SAHG component (adaptive kernel generation) is adopted, while the weight-redistributed loss and other auxiliary methods from the original paper are not central to the proposed contribution. This adaptation is integrated into the DEKR framework to enable robust benchmarking and evaluation against fixed-kernel baselines.

#### 3.2.1.1 Kernel Design

The adaptive Gaussian kernel is defined by the following parametric function (bivariate Gaussian):

$$
G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y \sqrt{1-\rho^2}} \, \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)} \left[ \frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-\mu_y)^2}{\sigma_y^2} - \frac{2\rho(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \right] \right )
$$

where:
- $\sigma_x, \sigma_y$: Scale parameters that adapt to the person's size
- $\rho$: Orientation (correlation) parameter that adjusts to the body part's orientation
- $\mu_x, \mu_y$: Center coordinates of the keypoint

For isotropic (scale-aware, orientation-agnostic) kernels:
- $\sigma_x = \sigma_y = \sigma_i$
- $\rho = 0$
- The kernel simplifies to:

$$
G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_i^2} \exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu_x)^2 + (y-\mu_y)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right )
$$

For anisotropic (orientation-aware) kernels:
- $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are set based on the estimated scale along the principal axes
- $\rho$ is derived from the orientation of the body part
- The full bivariate form above is used

The parameters are learned through a neural network that takes as input:

1. Local image features around the keypoint
2. Person instance scale information
3. Keypoint type and characteristics

#### 3.2.1.2 Scale Adaptation Mechanism

The scale adaptation mechanism is designed to handle varying person sizes in the image. This is achieved through:

1. **Person Scale Estimation**: Using a lightweight network to estimate the person's scale in the image
2. **Keypoint-Specific Scaling**: Adjusting kernel parameters based on both person scale and keypoint characteristics
3. **Dynamic Range Adjustment**: Ensuring the kernel size remains within practical limits for different scales

#### 3.2.1.3 Orientation Awareness

The orientation awareness component addresses the challenge of diverse body part orientations:

1. **Local Orientation Estimation**: Computing orientation from the spatial distribution of keypoints
2. **Adaptive Shape Adjustment**: Modifying the kernel shape based on the estimated orientation
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Ensuring gradual changes in orientation to maintain stability

   - Optimizing for real-time performance
   - Final validation on benchmark datasets

#### 3.2.2.2 Loss Function Design

The loss function combines multiple components to ensure robust learning:

1. **Localization Loss**: Measures the accuracy of keypoint localization
2. **Scale Consistency Loss**: Ensures consistent scale adaptation
3. **Orientation Smoothness Loss**: Promotes smooth orientation transitions
4. **Computational Efficiency Loss**: Penalizes excessive computational overhead

#### 3.2.2.3 Optimization Strategy

The optimization strategy employs:

1. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Using Adam optimizer with dynamic learning rate adjustment
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Preventing unstable updates in parameter space
3. **Regularization**: L2 regularization on kernel parameters to prevent overfitting
4. **Early Stopping**: Based on validation performance to ensure generalization
