   - Preprocess the data by resizing images, normalizing annotations, and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.  

2. **Gaussian Kernel Design**:  
   - Develop a parametric Gaussian kernel function with scale-dependent parameters, such as scale-aware standard deviation (Ïƒ) and kernel size.  

3. **Kernel Parameter Optimization**:  
   - Use a scale-aware loss function, such as scale-dependent mean squared error (MSE), to optimize kernel parameters.  

4. **Evaluation**:
